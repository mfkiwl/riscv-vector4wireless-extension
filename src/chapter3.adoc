== Vector Load and Store

=== vlfcA2B(vector load and format convert from format A to format B)
. *Grammar*
+
vlfcb2h.v  vd, rs1, vm +
vlfcb2w.v  vd, rs1, vm +
vlfch2w.v  vd, rs1, vm +
vlfcpa2c.v  vd, rs1, vm +
vlfcpb2c.v  vd, rs1, vm +

. *Purpose*
+
Load elements from vector memory to vector registers, performing format conversion operations at the same time. When mask is 0 when vm is enabled, the address and register element index need to be increased at the same time.

. *Description*
+
rs1 stores the base address, and vd is the target register. The total number of elements does not exceed VLEN/SEW*LMUL. SEW is the target format width. The formats of A2B include:
+
- ‘b2h’ is 8bit->16bit signed number conversion; 
- ‘b2w’ is 8bit->32bit signed number conversion; 
- ‘h2w’ is 16bit->32bit signed number conversion; 
- ‘pa2c’ is CFL(6/6/4)->SC16 format conversion； 
- ‘pb2c’ is CFL(7/7/2)->SC16 format conversion.

. *Operation*
+
----
vd[i] = loadFormatConvert(void *rs1, A2B) {
  switch(A2B)
    case ‘b2h’
      return sx16(int8 rs1[i])
    case ‘b2w’
      return sx32(int8 rs1[i])
    case ‘h2w’
      return sx32(int16 rs1[i])
    case ‘pa2c’
      i = get_i(sc16 rs1[i])
      r = get_r(sc16 rs1[i])
      e = get_e(sc16 rs1[i])
      I = zp32( i )
      R = zp32( r )
      return vcpack(sra(I, e), sra(R, e))
    case 'pb2c'
      // support in future
}

=== vsfcB2A(vector store and format convert from format B to format A)
. *Grammar*
+
vsfch2b.v  vs3, rs1, vm +
vsfcw2b.v  vs3, rs1, vm +
vsfcw2h.v  vs3, rs1, vm +
vsfcc2pa.v  vs3, rs1, vm +
vsfcc2pb.v  vs3, rs1, vm +

. *Purpose*
+
Convert format of each element from the vector register and store it into vector memory. When mask is 0 with vm is enabled, the address of vector memroy and register element index need to increased at the same time.

. *Description*
+
rs1 stores the base address, and vs3 is the source register. The total number of elements does not exceed VLEN/SEW*LMUL. SEW is the target format width. The formats of B2A include:
+
- ‘h2b’ is 16bit->8bit signed number conversion; 
- ‘w2b’ is 32bit->8bit signed number conversion; 
- ‘w2h’ is 32bit->16bit signed number conversion; 
- ‘c2pa’ is SC16->CFL(6/6/4) format conversion； 
- ‘c2pb’ is SC16->CFL(7/7/2) format conversion.

. *Operation*
+
----
void storeFormatConvert(void *rs1, vs3[i], B2A) {
  switch(B2A)
    case ‘h2b’
      vmem(clip_low_8(int16 vs3[i]), (int8*)rs1[i])
    case ‘w2b’
      vmem(clip_low_8(int32 vs3[i]), (int8*)rs1[i])
    case ‘w2h’
      vmem(clip_low_16(int32 vs3[i]), (int16*)rs1[i])
    case ‘c2pa’
      I = vs3[i].i
      R = vs3[i].r
      num = max(abs(I), abs(R))
      exp = lsb(num)
      img = round_clip_high_6bit(I << exp)
      real = round_clip_high_6bit(R << exp)
      vmem(cfp_pack(exp, img, real), (int16*)rs1[i])
   case 'c2pb'
      // support in future
}
