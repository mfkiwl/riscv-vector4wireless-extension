== Introduction

This document outlines a specialized vector extension instruction set based on the RISC-V RVV 1.0 specification, 
tailored for wireless digital signal processing. This extension supplements the RVV instruction set and primarily 
addresses the demands of wireless digital signal processing. 

Key additions include:

* Definitions for vector state register extension fields 
* Complex dynamic scaling operation instructions 
* Complex compressed format conversion instructions 
* Vector register inter-element operation instructions 
* Fixed-point dynamic scaling operation instructions  
* Dynamic scaling multiply-accumulate operation instructions
* Unified fast nonlinear operation instructions

Currently, RISC-V Vector Working Group developed the RVV 1.0 vector extension, widely applied in AI and image processing. However, these basic instructions do not fully satisfy the requirements of wireless broadband signal processing, which involves handling complex numbers in 4G and 5G communications and demands high-precision fixed-point dynamic scaling. Therefore, additional and more effective vector extension instructions are necessary for wireless communication, covering a significant segment of vector signal processing needs, especially for 4G and 5G technologies.  

The wireless signal processing extension instruction built on the RVV extension can accelerate advancements in 4G and 5G signal processing and facilitate the adoption of RISC-V in the wireless signal processing domain. The instruction set extends the RVV 1.0 specification to support high-bandwidth wireless communication signal processing. Termed the vector wireless broadband extension instruction set and represented by 'Zvw', it integrates into the basic 'v' extension. The Zvw extension adapts RVV instructions to better suit the high bandwidth, high-order modulation, and large throughput demands of wireless signal processing, particularly in 4G and 5G communications.
