== Registers

. *VCSR* (Vector Control and Status Register)
+
Add new fields to the vector control and status register (vcsr) to control the fixed-point multiplication with shift, fixed-point accumulation with shift, and funnel shift related instructions.

* _mulsft_ (multiply shift) controls the right shift operation after the multiplier operation. The right shift operation is round shift, and the round mode is controlled by vxrm. 

* _accsft_ (accumulated shift) controls the right shift operation of the accumulation operation. The shift operation is round shift, and the round mode is controlled by vxrm. 

* _fsft_ configures the shift length of the funnel shift, so that the operation can realize flexible funnel shift function without increasing the source operand.

. *VNLCR* (Vector non-linear Control Register)
+
This register is used to configure the function type and segmentation information of the nonlinear function. The register width is 32 bits, configured through the Zicsr extended instruction, address _0x00E_.

* _FuncId_ configures the type of the current nonlinear function; 

* _SegGruCnt_ configures the number of segments of the nonlinear function. The maximum number of segments of the nonlinear function is 16.
